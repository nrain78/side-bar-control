            we started our way towards the Hopper Valley. We drove by a riverbank where local families had built camps.
            They live there to search diamonds from the river.Then we started ascending to the mountains. Breathtaking
            mountain views, goats, the vivid autumn colors… you know, the usual. The sand road leading up was rather
            narrow at some points, so it almost got exciting. We passed many small villages with streets filled with
            happy kids on their way to school, seemingly excited to see some foreigners.In Hopper Valley, our driver
            parked the car in front of a “Hilton Restaurant”, which had (luckily) nothing to do with the actual Hilton
            chain. From here it would be around 2 hours to walk to the glacier and back. We were offered a guide, but we
            refused, confident that we will find the way on our own.We could see the glacier from afar but wanted to
            make it on top of it this time. The descent was quite steep. When we finally arrived at the side of the
            glacier, we searched for a way to get on top for a long time, as it was all muddy and hard to cross. The
            hard work paid off, as the views from on top of it were quite spectacular. We’ve never stood on a glacier
            before (the one in Passu doesn‘t count).We don’t often do daytrips like that. Hire a driver and tour around
            from one sightseeing point to another. But we would recommend to do this trip with a driver, as there were
            many things to see on the way that we would have missed by taking the public transport. As you could fit at
            least five or six passengers to a Landrover like that, it’s also very affordable when you share the costs.
