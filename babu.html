            the most beautiful place in the world and my most favorite “Babusar Top” - Famous for its thriving natural
            life, marvelous landscape and mountain vistas. The snow covered mountain enhances the beauty of the place.
            The magnificent view from that top is breathtaking. The place is at so much height that you almost hit the
            clouds there, the refreshing cool air keeps on passing through your soul and you feel like you are literally
            standing in Heaven. People do hiking in the snow and play with the snow and all the worldly matters and
            stresses just wipe away from your eyes and you just go deep into the beauty. I never wanted to come back
            from there. The place kept my heart in it. When I saw those mountains from the top all covered with snow,
            hearts were popping all over in my eyes and I never wanted to look away from that view. I never wanted to
            hear anything; I just wanted to keep staring at those mountains all day long. And I strongly believe that I
            would never ever get tired of watching them every day, all day long.As with all other treks, some things
            should best be kept in mind to ensure the safety of the entire hiking team.
            All members should make sure that they do not go to the very edges of the Babusar Top hills, as there may be
            erosion which can lead to crumbling ledges.
            Never stray far from the group while on steep edges.
            Always make sure where the footing is when taking photographs and never walk backwards when taking the
            photographs.
