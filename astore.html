            The sky was gray but the sound of the current, produced by the thawing glaciers, announced the arrival of
            summer. A group of engineers, who were governmental employees, allowed me to stay at their shack. I woke up
            with the sunrise and the sound of the teapot being heated up. The wave of spring-like cold did not prevent
            me going outside to gaze at the sublime landscape.
            <br>
            My mouth was extremely dry, as I was drinking my second cup of tea with salt and my third piece of plain,
            dry paratha (a local bread), the traditional, regional breakfast. However, I didnâ€™t care much about it, as I
            was at the heart and remotest part of the Astore Valley, a paradise with a strong historical symbolism,
            which only a few foreigners have ever visited.
            <br>
            The landscape that makes up the valley is not only of a colossal beauty but is also, composed of large
            geographic variety and contrasts, offering the adventurous traveler endless trekking options, as well as the
            opportunity to get immersed in a culture which not many tourists have ever had the chance to avidence to visit. <br>
            For centuries, this route was used as a commercial connection between Gilgit and the region of Kashmir. The
            Gibians used to go to Srinagar (the main city in Kashmir) to study, as well as importing a wide variety of
            products, such as the famous Kashmiri fabrics.
